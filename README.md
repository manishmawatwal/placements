# Estimation

## A pharmaceutical company wants to sell a pill for diabetic patients in India. Estimate the market of the pill.
To estimate the potential market for a diabetes pill in India, we can use a top-down guesstimation approach by breaking the problem into smaller steps. Here's how to estimate the market size:

Step 1: Population of India
India’s population is approximately 1.4 billion people (2025 estimate).

Step 2: Prevalence of Diabetes in India
The prevalence of diabetes in India is around 10-11% of the adult population, based on studies and reports.
Assume 60% of the population is above 18 years old (adults).
- Adult population = 1.4 × 0.6 = 0.84 billion (840 million adults).
- Diabetic population = 0.84×0.10=0.084billion (84 million people).

Step 3: Target Market for the Pill

Not all diabetic patients will use this specific pill. Factors to consider:

1. Type of diabetes:
Assume 90% of diabetics have Type 2 diabetes (most likely to use the pill).
- Type 2 diabetic population = 0.084×0.90=0.0756billion (75.6 million people).

2. Affordability and access:
Assume 50% of the population has access to and can afford modern medications.
- Accessible market = 0.0756×0.50=0.0378billion (37.8 million people).

3. Competitor penetration:
Assume competitors already capture 50% of the accessible market.
- Potential market = 0.0378×0.50=0.0189billion (18.9 million people).

Step 4: Pill consumption rate

Assume each patient consumes 1 pill per day (standard for diabetes treatment).
Annual pill requirement per person:
Pills per year=365pills.

Step 5: Estimate total annual demand
- Total pills per year = 18.9 × 10^6 × 365 = 6.9 × 10^9 pills (6.9 billion pills).

Step 6: Estimate the revenue potential

If the company sells each pill at an average price of ₹5 per pill:
- Annual revenue = 6.9 × 10^9 × 5 = 34.5 × 10^9 (₹34.5 billion).

Final Estimate:
1. Potential market size: Approximately 18.9 million diabetic patients in India.
2. Annual demand: Around 6.9 billion pills.
3. Annual revenue potential: ₹34.5 billion, assuming ₹5 per pill.

This estimate depends on assumptions about population demographics, healthcare access, and competition. Further refinement would require actual market data.
